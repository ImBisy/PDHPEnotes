              Risk-taking is the conscious or unconscious decision to expose
              oneself to the possibility of harm or loss. Risks can be physical,

              a negative outcome and the potential severity of consequences. Not
              all risks are negative—some can lead to growth, learning, or

                      Depressants slow down the central nervous system (CNS),
                      reducing arousal and stimulation. They can cause

                      impair coordination and judgment.
